Note that we need to use subqueries for handling the tallest and shortest height calculations:\n\n```sql\nWITH Tallest AS (\n    SELECT \n        p.id AS player_id,\n        p.player_name,\n        pa.finishing\n    FROM \n        Player p\n    JOIN \n        Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\n    WHERE \n        p.height = (SELECT MAX(height) FROM Player)\n),\nShortest AS (\n    SELECT \n        p.id AS player_id,\n        p.player_name,\n        pa.finishing\n    FROM \n        Player p\n    JOIN \n        Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\n    WHERE \n        p.height = (SELECT MIN(height) FROM Player)\n)\n\nSELECT \n    'Tallest' AS Height_Category,\n    player_name,\n    AVG(finishing) AS Average_Finishing\nFROM \n    Tallest\n\nUNION ALL\n\nSELECT \n    'Shortest' AS Height_Category,\n    player_name,\n    AVG(finishing) AS Average_Finishing\nFROM \n    Shortest;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Query:\n- The query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to isolate the tallest and shortest players from the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables.\n- It computes the average finishing rates for these two sets of players.\n- The results are combined using `UNION ALL`, allowing you to see both the tallest and shortest players with their corresponding average finishing rates in one query output.\n\nThis approach will yield a comparison between the finishing rates of the tallest and shortest football players.

This suggests that we might be assuming prior information about the schema or missing an attributes table that maps attributes to superheroes.\n\nAssuming you have a way to access intelligence data through another attributes table (which would typically link attributes to superheroes), here is a structured approach to how you would find the answer:\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Select Tables**: Ideally, use an attributes table (which could include intelligence and link to superheroes), or else the plan will focus on the given superhero table if no attributes are defined.\n\n2. **Columns Needed**: \n   - From the superhero table:\n     - `superhero_name`: The name of the superhero.\n     - `full_name`: The full name of the superhero.\n     - `id`: The unique identifier of the superhero.\n\n3. **Check for Attributes Table**: \n   - If there is an additional table with superhero attributes such as intelligence (the preferred structure would be an attributes or powers table that includes `attribute_name` and `attribute_value`), join this table.\n\n4. **Filter for Intelligence**:\n   - Apply a filter that targets `attribute_name = \'Intelligence\'` to focus on this specific attribute.\n\n5. **Find the Minimum Intelligence**:\n   - Use a `MIN` function to identify the lowest intelligence value from the filtered results.\n\n6. **Retrieve the Corresponding Superhero**:\n   - After obtaining the lowest intelligence value, filter the joined data to retrieve the superhero linked to that intelligence value.\n\n7. **Return the Result**: Output the superhero’s name and full name who has the lowest intelligence.\n\nIf the intelligence attribute does not exist, you would need to revise your schema or clarify if there is an alternative method to derive the intelligence information for superheroes. As it stands, you would effectively find the superhero with the lowest intelligence record using this logical structure.' type='TextMessage'

Question: What is the ratio of customers who pay in EUR against customers who pay in CZK?
 db_id: debit_card_specializing
Planner: Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Identify the table containing currency information:** The `customers` table has a `Currency` column.

2. **Count customers paying in EUR:** We'll use a `COUNT` aggregate function with a `WHERE` clause to filter for customers where `Currency = 'EUR'`.

3. **Count customers paying in CZK:**  Similarly, we'll use `COUNT` with a `WHERE` clause to filter for `Currency = 'CZK'`.

4. **Calculate the ratio:**  Divide the count of EUR customers by the count of CZK customers.

5. **Handle potential division by zero:** Consider adding a `CASE` statement to handle the scenario where there are no customers paying in CZK to avoid division by zero errors.

NL2SQL: ```sql
SELECT
  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Currency = 'EUR' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN Currency = 'CZK' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
FROM customers;
```
Critic: ```sql
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Currency = 'EUR' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN Currency = 'CZK' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM Customers
```
